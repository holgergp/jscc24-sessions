## How to Measure Page Speed

We looked roughly into the [Performance API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance)
which is useful for doing [RUM measurements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Real_User_Monitoring).

RUM is performance analysis based on the real useragents' data, the complementary
way of [measuring "lab data"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Synthetic_monitoring)
for example using Lighthouse on a computer that is not the end customer's computer but a lab computer,
for example in the cloud somewhere and it "looks at" the page from time to time.

We looked at tools like treo.sh
